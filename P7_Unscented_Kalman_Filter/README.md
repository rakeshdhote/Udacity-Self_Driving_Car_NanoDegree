# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---
The objective of this project is to perform sensor fusion of laser and radar data for navigation of a self-driving car. 
Unscented Kalman filter is implemented for predicting the next state of a car and sensor fusion.
