# Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree 
# Model Predictive Controller (MPC)
- - - 

## 1. Project Overview   
The objective of this project is to control a self-driving car autonomously via model predictive controller (MPC) around a simulator lake course. 




## 2. MPC  - Model   

$\text{S}_1(N) = \sum_{p=1}^N \text{E}(p)$


## 3. Setting up PID hyper parameters   



## Basic Build Instructions 
1. Clone this repo. 
2. Make a build directory:  `mkdir build && cd build` 
3. Compile:  `cmake .. && make` 
4. Run it:  `./mpc`.
